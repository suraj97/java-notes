    <p> Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest 
        for readers to scan, but they can also be separated
        by indenting their first lines. This is often used 
        to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.       
        Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school
        papers and rough drafts, uses both blank lines and 
        indentation for separation. In finished works, combining 
        both is considered redundant and amateurish.</p>

    In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a 
    special character:  the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this
    is considered claustrophobic and hard to read.

<p> Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media.[1] Video was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which were later replaced by flat panel displays of several types.
video systems vary in display resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, color capabilities and other qualities. Analog and digital variants exist and can be carried on a variety of media, including radio broadcast, magnetic tape, optical discs, computer files, and network streaming.

<p>In computing, DOC or doc (an abbreviation of "document") is a filename extension for word processing documents, most commonly in the proprietary Microsoft Word Binary File Format.[4] Historically, the extension was used for documentation in plain text, particularly of programs or computer hardware on a wide range of operating systems. During the 1980s, WordPerfect used DOC as the extension of their proprietary format. Later, in 1983, Microsoft chose to use the DOC extension for their proprietary Microsoft Word format. These uses for the extension have largely disappeared from the PC world.

    A test or examination (informally, exam or evaluation) is an assessment intended to measure a test-taker's knowledge, skill, aptitude, physical fitness, or classification in many other topics (e.g., beliefs).[1] A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills. Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements

     For example, in a closed book test, a test taker is usually required to rely upon memory to respond to specific items whereas in an open book test, a test taker may use one or more supplementary tools such as a reference book or calculator when responding. A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test would be a reading test administered by a parent to a child. A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an I.Q.

    A reader is someone who visits Wikipedia articles to read rather than edit the content. Editors, often referred to as Wikipedians if logged in, also read Wikipedia of course, but other than reading they also edit the pages to help build the encyclopedia.
    Wikipedia currently has 5,933,116 articles that are edited by 128,690 active editors. Since 2007 Wikipedia has been one of the ten most popular websites[1] and the Main Page receives hundreds of millions of hits per month. In June 2012 it had 227 million hits.[2] Individual articles vary in popularity depending on the shifting Zeitgeist.
